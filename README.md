# Insight about the Project

Working on this project has been good so far , we have implemented every thing learnt from the basics of git to the HTML elements even though we haven't touched all the HTML elements with what we have it is easy to manage, implement and understand.
The pace is great so far in addition the version control system has been so useful and it will definitely take time and practices to get used to

the project has covered topics regarding HTML with elements like headings, links , lists both ordered and unordered , img , and some cool attributes that are useful to make some HTML element have full functionality. few attributes stand out to me , the rel = "noopener referrer" that provide both security and privacy, i am enjoying using them in every situation where the target of the anchor element needs to be \_blank

Being able to actually execute and seeing the expected result is so satisfying and encouraging in order to reach new heights

# Project
